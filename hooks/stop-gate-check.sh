# (scripts/roach.py check). If the enforcer reports findings — open gates,
# stale resume brief, unverifiable evidence commits, malformed state —
# the hook exits 2, which tells Claude Code to block the stop and feed
# the message back to the agent so it keeps working.

# State dir: .roach/ (project root). Enforcer: .roach/bin/roach.py.
# The hook receives the project dir via CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR; falls back to PWD.
